# Tarot Guesser

[Insert image of website mockup]

The Tarot Guesser game was designed in line with Code Institutes Project Portfolio 2's guidelines and aimed at people looking to play a fun game
of guessing which Tarot Card is which. This can be used as a fun and educational way to learn the Major Arcana of the vast Tarot deck.

The targets of this website and game were to be people who have a mild or major interest in the Tarot Deck and are looking for something fun to do relative to their 
interests. As an aside this can be used as an entertaining way to learn and stay fresh on the cards, their numbers, and depictions.
